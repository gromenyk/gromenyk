## About myself  
Hi, my name is Gerardo Romeny. I´m currently learning Full Stack Web Development in a Bootcamp from Universidad del Desarrollo, Chile, so what I have been learning is:
1. HTML.
2. CSS.
3. GIT.
4. GitHub
5. JavaScript.

Still a lot of other things to learn, which I will be adding them as long as I move forward in the learning curve.

I´m looking forward to make a slight shift in my career after being CFO of an hospital and, after that, owning my own company of importation and distribution of orthopaedic and special needs products. Why? Because I realized what I mostly enjoyed in the process of being an entrepreneur was building the website!!
