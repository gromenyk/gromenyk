## About myself  
Hi, my name is Gerardo Romeny. I´m currently learning Full Stack Web Development in a Bootcamp from Universidad del Desarrollo, Chile, so what I have been learning is:

[![JS](./icons/js.png)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
[![GIT](./icons/git.png)](https://git-scm.com/)
[![GITHUB](./icons/github.png)](https://github.com/)
[![VSC](./icons/visual-studio.png)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Still a lot of other things to learn, which I will be adding them as long as I move forward in the learning curve.

I´m looking forward to make a slight shift in my career after being CFO of an hospital and, after that, owning my own company of importation and distribution of orthopaedic and special needs products. Why? Because I realized what I mostly enjoyed in the process of being an entrepreneur was building the website!!
